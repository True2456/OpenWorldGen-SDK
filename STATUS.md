## Mission (1 paragraph)

Fully procedural 4×4 km open world in the browser. WebGPU only (three.js WebGPURenderer + TSL +
raw WGSL compute), TypeScript strict, zero `any`, zero external assets, deterministic by
`?seed=N`. Visual bar: the four UE5-class reference images in `reference/` (noon forest ravine
w/ cobbled streambed; gully close-up; karst tower forest in haze; golden-hour serrated alpine
vista w/ snow + cloud sea below summits — "Witcher" frame). 8 gated phases; verification by
Playwright screenshots compared against references; `DELTA.md` loop each phase. Must ALSO be
smooth + explorable interactively by the user (fly camera, ToD control, bookmarks) — user
feedback comes in chat; the two-frame test is the agent-side acceptance only.

## Hard rules digest (full text = spec §)

- No black/gray shadows (Pillar B); no bare terrain within 10 m (Pillar A/§9); no cloned trees;
  no smooth silhouettes on hero rock/tree; no fog-as-cover; no `MeshBasicMaterial`; no CPU
  per-instance updates; no one-file architecture; never ask user to lower the bar.
- Floors (§2): ≥5M tris forest hero / ≥3M vista post-culling; 4096² heightfield sim; erosion
  ≥500 iters @ ≥2048²; ≥6 tree species w/ per-instance uniqueness; hero tree ≥100k tris; hero
  rock ≥200k tris; grass ≥800k blades; debris ≥80k; particles ≥100k; visible range ≥4 km;
  ≥5 biomes incl. alpine snow; probes ≥24×24×6 per chunk; CSM 4×≥2048² + PCSS + contact
  shadows; raymarched 2-layer clouds + cloud shadows; Hillaire atmosphere; 60 fps @ 1440p
  target hardware class.
- Infeasible item → nearest feasible alternative + entry in `DEVIATIONS.md`. A closed phase has
  zero TODOs in its code.

## Verified environment facts

- macOS 26.4 (Darwin 25.4.0), Apple **M1 Max 32-core GPU**, Metal 4, 3456×2234 display.
- Node v22.12.0, npm 10.9.0. Git repo initialized on `main` (no remote).
- three.js pinned: **0.184.0** (latest on npm as of 2026-06-10). VERIFY APIs against
  `node_modules/three/` source before use — do not trust memory for TSL surface.
- **Playwright WebGPU recipe (SOLVED)**: `chromium.launch({ headless: true, channel: 'chromium' })`
  → apple/metal-3 adapter. Two traps: (1) WebGPU only exists on secure contexts — probe on
  http://localhost:5173, never about:blank; (2) default Playwright headless = GPU-less
  "headless shell"; `channel:'chromium'` selects full Chromium new-headless. Cached in
  `.cache/webgpu-flags.json` by tools/launch.ts.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (background, port 5173 strict). Shots:
  `npx tsx tools/shoot.ts --scene X --cam "..." --out shots/x.png [--hud 1] [--stats f.json]`.
  Compare: `npx tsx tools/compare.ts --a ours.png --b reference/sceneN.png --out cmp.png`.
  Pixel sampling (shadow-color test): `--sample img.png --px "x,y;x,y"`.
- Sanity scene measured (1080p, M1 Max): 3.1M tris @ 117 fps, render 7.2 ms — lots of headroom.

## Phase checklist

- [x] **Phase 0** — DONE 2026-06-10. Scaffold, WebGPU init + fail-loud diagnostics, HUD, fly
      camera, params, Playwright shot harness (headless WebGPU working), compare tool. Gate
      passed: `shots/phase-0/cmp_sanity_vs_scene1.png`. Proven: compute→storage→instanced draw,
      compute→StorageTexture→sampling, TSL vertex displacement, CPU procedural geometry,
      GPU timestamps, deterministic seeding.
- [ ] **Phase 1** — heightfield synth (ridged fBm + uplift + tower-karst term) 4096²; pipe-model
      hydraulic + thermal erosion; flow accumulation → rivers → lakes; moisture; biome + snow
      classification; quadtree tiles + far-detail synthesis; triplanar/splat terrain material w/
      macro variation; `?scene=terrain` erosion split view. Gate: silhouette+tiling checks, DELTA.
- [ ] **Phase 2** — Hillaire LUT atmosphere + aerial perspective; EV auto-exposure; IBL from sky;
      CSM×4 + PCSS + screen-space contact shadows; volumetric clouds + temporal reproj + cloud
      shadows; TAA, GTAO, bloom, per-ToD filmic grade (teal-orange golden). Gate: golden vista vs
      Witcher ref; shadow-color test.
- [ ] **Phase 3** — irradiance probe clipmap (GPU, time-sliced, sky+sun+bounce), GTAO tuning,
      screen-space bounce, foliage translucency. Gate: forest interior vs scene1; no-black-shadows.
- [ ] **Phase 4** — generators: 6+ tree species (per-instance growth), rocks/cliffs, grass, ferns,
      shrubs×3, flowers×4 (incl. pink shrub), deadfall, debris classes, procedural texture arrays,
      dressing systems (moss/vines/ledge ferns/root flare/fungi/staining), octahedral impostors,
      `?scene=gallery`. Gate: gallery sheet + macro-meso-micro audit.
- [ ] **Phase 5** — GPU scatter (clustered Poisson, density fns), chunk streaming, meshlet/cluster
      culling + Hi-Z + indirect, LOD/impostor transitions (dithered), far forests as canopy
      shells. Gate: repetition flight; throughput floors (HUD-verified).
- [ ] **Phase 6** — stream water (refraction/caustics/foam/wet margins), lakes (planar refl),
      hierarchical wind, froxel volumetrics (canopy shafts, valley fog), GPU particles
      (snow/pollen/leaves). Gate: streambed close-up vs scene1/2.
- [ ] **Phase 7** — perf pass (60fps@1440p / reduced preset), HUD full (per-pass GPU timings),
      9 bookmarks, 90s flythrough, full battery, final two-frame test, self-score rubric.
- [ ] **Tier 3** — only after battery passes (see spec §11).

## Current focus

**Phase 1 — terrain.** Architecture: all terrain state lives in GPU textures owned by
`src/world/Heightfield.ts`; passes in `src/gpu/passes/`. Sub-steps:
1. [ ] World constants module (4096 m world, height scale, sea/lake levels, biome zones per D3).
2. [ ] `HeightfieldSynthesisPass` — 4096² r32float height: continent/uplift macro spectra +
       domain-warped ridged fBm (alpine NE) + tower-karst term (center-S) + valley carve guide.
3. [ ] `ErosionPass` — pipe-model hydraulic (height/water/sediment/flux/velocity ping-pong) +
       thermal talus; ≥500 iters at 2048² active grid (ultra: 4096²); progress to boot UI.
4. [ ] `FlowPass` — particle-traced flow accumulation (atomics) → river mask → channel carve →
       lake fill relaxation → moisture field.
5. [ ] `BiomeClassifyPass` — temperature(altitude,latitude) × moisture × slope × exposure →
       biome id + snow coverage factor (slope/altitude/exposure + dithered blend + ledge term).
6. [ ] Normal/curvature/AO-approx maps derived from final height.
7. [ ] `TerrainTiles` — quadtree CDLOD rings around camera, GPU-displaced, crack-free morphing,
       skirts; far-detail synthesis term in shader beyond ~1.5 km; frustum culled per tile.
8. [ ] Terrain material — triplanar TSL: strata rock on steep, soil/litter/grass-color flats,
       scree fans, snow w/ dithered edge + ledge accumulation, macro variation (2–50 m breakup),
       cavity dirt, moisture darkening. (Real texture arrays come in Phase 4 TexSynth; Phase 1
       uses procedural-in-shader splats good enough to judge silhouettes/tiling.)
9. [ ] `?scene=terrain` debug: erosion before/after split view, biome/moisture/flow view modes.
10. [ ] Gate: silhouette + tiling checks vs references at vista range; DELTA.md; fix top 3; commit.

## Next actions (always keep current)

- Phase 1 step 1: write `src/world/WorldConst.ts` + macro-layout guide functions, then synthesis pass.

## Key decisions log

- **D1** Pin three@0.184.0; mitigation for API drift: read installed source, keep notes in
  docs/THREE-NOTES.md. Downgrade to 0.180.x only if 0.184 breaks something structural.
- **D2** Tracking: STATUS.md (this file) = source of truth; harness task list mirrors phases
  (tasks #1–#8 = phases 0–7); git commit per milestone. DELTA.md / DEVIATIONS.md per spec.
- **D3** World macro-layout is code-guided for art direction (composed, per Pillar E): main
  glacial U-valley NE→SW with river → lake in SW low corner; serrated alpine massif N/NE
  (Witcher frame); tower-karst forest ravine biome center-S (scene1/3); meadows + rolling
  forest between; wetland margin at lake. Detail fully procedural + seed-driven.
- **D4** Verification screenshots: prefer headless Playwright Chromium with WebGPU/Metal flags;
  fall back to headed if headless adapter unavailable. (Resolved Phase 0 → record flags above.)
- **D5** Per-instance tree uniqueness strategy: K structural variants per species per LOD ring
  + continuous per-instance GPU deformation (lean/droop/crown asymmetry/age/hue) + bespoke
  unique meshes for nearest hero trees (background-generated, cached). Document in DEVIATIONS.
- **D6** Erosion default 2048² active grid (spec floor) on 4096² synth field; `?quality=ultra`
  runs 4096². Decide final default by measured load time (~budget ≤15 s gen).

## Reference image analysis (art targets)

- `scene1.png` 1920×1080-class, noon ravine: cobbled dry streambed w/ trickle, rounded mossy
  boulders, dark cliff overhangs framing top corners, lush karst towers midground, luminous
  white-blue haze bg. Shadows: blue-gray on rock, green-filled in foliage. Value structure:
  dark frame → lit mid → bright bg.
- `scene2.png` gully close-up: deadfall logs across cobbles, deep-green mossy overhang (shadowed
  but COLORFUL), sunlit tower behind.
- `scene3.png` karst forest vista: dozens of vegetated rock towers receding through 4+ haze
  layers; canopy sea between towers; soft broken-cloud toplight.
- `02_Silver_Demo_Wallpaper...png` (Witcher IV, 3840×2160): golden hour alpine; dark foreground
  outcrop + figure (silhouette framing); serrated rust-red peaks w/ slope-correct snow; conifer
  slopes down to huge hazy valley; cloud sea BELOW summits wrapping ridges; god rays from
  upper-left sun; teal-orange split (warm rock/lit conifers vs cool snow shadows/valley haze);
  scattered dead snags on right slope.
- Implied landforms: serrated ridged massif + vertical-walled tower karst + glacial valley.
  Terrain synthesis needs an explicit tower/mesa formation term, not just ridged fBm.

## Gotchas / lessons learned (append-only)

- WebGPU secure-context + headless-shell traps → see "Verified environment facts".
- TSL `.assign()/.addAssign()/.toVar()` require an active stack (inside `Fn()`); material node
  graphs are NOT inside Fn → shared TSL helpers must be pure expression builders (NoiseTSL is).
- @types/three 0.184 types nodes generically: use `Node<'vec3'>` aliases from `src/gpu/TSLTypes.ts`
  (`NF/NV2/NV3/NV4…`); bare `Node` has no operators/swizzles.
- `three` and `three/webgpu` both re-export from `three.core.js` — safe to mix imports.
- `StorageTexture` defaults rgba8unorm + `mipmapsAutoUpdate=true` (auto mips after compute
  writes when generateMipmaps). For float data set `.type = FloatType` etc.
- Verify cast shadows w/ custom `positionNode` on instanced meshes when real shadows land
  (Phase 2) — sanity scene shadows looked absent; may need `material.shadowPositionNode`.
